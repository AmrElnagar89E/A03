Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

- **Branch** : GitHub creates the repository with a single branch. This first branch in the repository is the default branch. The default branch is the branch that GitHub displays when anyone visits your repository and with them you can move around the project.
- **Clone** : copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub.com has at that point in time
- **Commit** : git commit creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at specific times.
- **Fetch** : The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repository. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on. 
- **GIT** : Git is a version control tool (software) to track the changes in the source code.
- **Github** : GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
- **Merge** : Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
- **Merge Conflict** : Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.
- **Push** : The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
- **Pull** : Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
- **Remote** : A remote repository in Git, also called a remote, is a Git repository that's hosted on the Internet or another network.
- **Repository** : A repository is the most basic fundamental element of GitHub. In a way, the whole world of GitHub is centered on this one basic thing called a repository. It is like a folder that contains all the files and documentation related to your project.
